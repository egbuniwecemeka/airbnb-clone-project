6. Review System
Endpoints - /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/

7. Database Optimizations
Indexing
Caching

## Technology Stack

## Feature Breakdown

1. Users (Accounts & Profiles)
Features:
User registration & login - authentication, email/password, optional social media login
Profile management - name, profile pic, phone no etc.
User roles - Customer/Guest, Host, Admin

Features:
Create, update, and delete property/listing.
Upload images, descriptions, pricing, availability.
Categorization (type of property or product).
Search and filter (location, price range, availability, etc.).
Map integration (optional, if geographic locations matter).
Owner can manage multiple properties

3. Bookings (Reservations / Orders)
Features:

Refunds & cancellations.
Commission handling (platform takes % cut if needed).
Payouts to property owners (if multi-vendor).

## API Security

1. Authentication
What it is: Verifies who the user is (e.g., login via username/password, OAuth, JWT tokens, API keys).

2. Authorization
What it is: Controls what an authenticated user can do. eg Role-based access control (RBAC)

3. Rate Limiting & Throttling
What it is: Prevents abuse by limiting how many API requests a client can make in a given time frame.

4. Data Validation & Sanitization
What it is: Ensures only expected, safe data enters the system

5. Encryption (in transit & at rest)
What it is: Protects sensitive data during storage and communication.

6. Logging & Monitoring
What it is: Track activity for detection of suspicious behavior. e.g., DataDog, ELK stack

7. CORS & API Gateway Security
What it is: Controls which domains can access your APIs.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline is the automated process that connects these steps — from code commit → testing → deploymen

Role in Automating Development Process

Automation – No need for manual builds, tests, or deployments.
Speed – Developers deliver new features and bug fixes quickly.
Reliability – Automated tests catch errors before production.
Consistency – The same process is used every time, reducing human error.
Collaboration – Teams can integrate changes frequently, avoiding last-minute conflicts

Tools: GitHub Actions, Docker
